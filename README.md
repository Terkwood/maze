This is a port of Jamis Buck's work on [recursively backtracking mazes](https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2010/12/27/maze-generation-recursive-backtracking) to Godot 3.2.

## usage

You can export the app to Mac, Win, or Linux/X11, or, if you have `godot` installed system-wide and available in your path:

```sh
godot
```
